# Shelfie

A single page web application allowing a user to create a detailed summary of books they have read, and highlight favorite quotes. A user may edit any book they add to the database, as well as quotes, and save as many quotes as they wish. 

The app is built using a Rails API backend, and JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The Rails API was created with a Postgres database.

# Live Demo 
To play with a live version of this project, you can go [here](https://dani8439.github.io/shelfie_frontend/). The backend has been hosted online using heroku, and connected to the frontend through github pages. The instructions below are no longer applicable as some of the source code has been altered in order to facilitate a live demo of the site.
